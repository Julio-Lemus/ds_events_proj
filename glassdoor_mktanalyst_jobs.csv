Backed by 8VC, Founders Fund, and other prominent leaders in Silicon Valley, Hearth has raised over $50M and is one of the fastest growing companies in the home improvement space.

The Mission
To us, the home improvement contractor is a true embodiment of the American Dream – skilled craftspeople who choose to start their own business to build a better life for their families and their communities.
While home improvement professionals power a $500 billion per year industry and protect the homes of millions of Americans, they are typically overlooked by Wall Street and Silicon Valley, and are one of the most underserved, undercapitalized, and written-off segments of entrepreneurs.
We built Hearth to tip the odds of success in their favor. Hearth is a seamless digital toolkit that helps home improvement pros win more projects, grow their sales, and save time running their business. In the last six years, we’ve built an industry-leading technology platform (Financing, Payments, Quotes, Contracts, and Banking), work with over 15,000 contractors, and have funded over $500 million in additional projects for home improvement pros. And, we are just getting started.

Our tools are for decision makers within corrections and sentencing, from parole officers to agency leadership to people impacted by the system. That's where you come in. We're looking for someone with attention to detail to provide rigor to impact analyses, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About us
Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for justice-involved people. We build tech that reduces the number of people in prison and helps criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.
Using modern data infrastructure and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, justice-impacted individuals, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.
People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them.

Data Analysis - analyze and identify key trends in product usage and impact. Work closely with the Data Analytics and Data Science (DADS) team to ensure accurate, scalable, and reliable sources for dashboard development. Conduct adhoc analysis as needed to further insights.
Wild success
Within one year in the role, you'll have achieved wild success if we see that Recidiviz has reliable, standardized, interpretable, and readily-accessible impact metrics in Looker that meet the needs of the Office of the CEO, the Product Team, and the State Engagement Team.

More about Recidiviz
Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.
Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) 11 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers 25% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.
